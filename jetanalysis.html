		  <h3> Jet Content Analysis in Hadronic Collisions </h3>
		  <p> During my sophomore summer vacation and the duration of my senior
			year, I worked on the research project that would become my senior
			thesis. </p>
		  <p> Initially, work was started at Wayne State University through their
			REU program, where I was assigned the task of processing large
			quantities of data in order to perform statistical analysis and
			determine whether certain observables the team had previously posited
			were physically significant. </p>
		  <p> The project flow was relatively simple, with a three step process used
			to create data, analyze and break that data down, then perform the
			necessary analysis and print graphs. </p>
			<br>
		  <h4> 1. Data generation </h4>
		  <p> For data generation, we used a Monte Carlo-based event generator known
			as Pythia, which is capable of creating fairly accurate particle
			collision events given a large number of specified initial conditions.
			For this project, we simulated the 2013 ATLAS LHC p-p runs so we had a
			verified collection of datato perform sanity checks on our own results.
			This data was then saved to a custom structure breaking individual
			resultant particles into their base information, which was stored into
			another event structure. These were then saved off to a file for further
			processing by the next phase.
			<br>
		  </p>
		  <br>
		  <h4> 2. Data processing (jet finding) </h4>
		  <p> In the second stage, we take the output information from Pythia and
			process the resultant particles to search for the jets we want to find.
			In this case, a jet is a high-energy particle which is ejected from the
			point of impact at high transverse velocity. Using FastJet, we are able
			to take the particle data from Pythia and get a set of grouped vectors
			of particles which belong to what FastJet believes is a jet. These are
			then saved off to another file, similar to the process in stage one. </p>
			<br>
		  <h4> 3. Data analysis and graphing </h4>
		  <p> In the third and final stage, the collected data and information from
			stage two is taken and general average statistics are generated from the
			multiplicity of events. This gives us the averages we require to
			calculate the observables which have been developed by the team long
			before I arrived. Using ROOT, we print these observables and helpful
			statistics as histograms, generally as functions of multiplicity. </p>
