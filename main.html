			<p>Got quite a few things changed on the site, you'll notice some PHP here and there now! <b><i>Magic.</b></i>
			<br><br>
			The blog is functional in the most barebones sense, just reads a few fields from an SQL table. But for a start, it will
			do just fine! In the near future I'll have some sort of paging system in place, maybe some search functionality, and eventually
			some sort of text parsing so I can stop using html tags in the body lol.
			<br><br>
			Also check out the prototype of the music/albums bit. So far it's loading up a few albums I've taken the time to enter in
			and those seem to be working fine. Got the scaling working ok.
			<br><br>
			Now I'm just treating this like blog 2.0. Ach, I should actually figure out something to put here. Oh well. Hi Alex, if you see this.
